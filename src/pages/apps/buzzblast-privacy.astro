			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				BuzzBlast ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our quiz buzzer and soundboard application.

			<h2>Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
			<p>
				To improve the app experience, we use the following services:
