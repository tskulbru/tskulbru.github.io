			</p>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>

			<h3>How does Neimr work?</h3>
			<p>
				Neimr helps couples, families, and friends find names everyone loves:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a survey and choose a category (baby names, pet names, etc.)</li>
				<li>Swipe through curated name suggestions</li>
				<li>Share your survey with your partner or friends</li>
				<li>See instant matches when you both like the same name</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>How do I create a survey?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the "+" button on the home screen</li>
				<li>Choose a category (Baby, Pet, Business, etc.)</li>
				<li>Customize filters like style and origin (optional)</li>
				<li>Start swiping!</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>How do I invite my partner?</h3>
			<p>
				To share a survey with your partner:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the survey you want to share</li>
				<li>Tap the "Share" or "Invite" button</li>
				<li>Send the link to your partner via Messages, WhatsApp, or any app</li>
				<li>When they open the link, they'll join your survey</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

			<h3>What do the swipe actions mean?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Swipe Right (or tap heart):</strong> You like this name</li>
				<li><strong>Swipe Left (or tap X):</strong> Not for you</li>
				<li><strong>Swipe Up (or tap star):</strong> Super like - you love this name!</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>How do matches work?</h3>
			<p>
				When you and your partner both swipe right on the same name, it becomes a match! Matches appear in the Results tab of your survey. Super likes from either person are highlighted.
			</p>

			<h3>Can I undo a swipe?</h3>
			<p>
				Yes! Tap the undo button to go back to the previous name. Free users get 1 undo per session, while Premium users have unlimited undos.
			</p>

			<h3>How do I save my favorite names?</h3>
			<p>
				Names you super like are automatically added to your Favorites. You can also add names from your matches to Favorites by tapping the heart icon.
			</p>

			<h3>Can I use Neimr alone?</h3>
			<p>
				Absolutely! You can swipe through names and save favorites without inviting anyone. Sharing is optional but makes name decisions more fun and collaborative.
