			<h2>Overview</h2>

				Neimr collects the following information to provide our services:
			</p>

			<h3>Account Information</h3>

				<li>Survey/session data you create</li>
				<li>Matches with your partner or collaborators</li>
				<li>Favorite names you've saved</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
			<p>

			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide the name matching and collaboration features</li>
				<li>Sync your data across your devices</li>

				<li>Data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
				<li>We use Firebase Security Rules to ensure users can only access their own data</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
			<p>
				To improve the app experience, we use the following services:
			</p>

			<h3>Firebase Analytics</h3>
			<p>
				We use Firebase Analytics to understand general app usage patterns. This includes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Feature usage statistics (anonymized)</li>
				<li>App launch frequency</li>
				<li>Screen views and user flows</li>

			</ul>
			<p>
				This data is anonymized and aggregated. We cannot identify individual users from this information.
			</p>

			<h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
			<p>

			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Device model and OS version</li>
				<li>App version</li>
				<li>Crash stack traces</li>
				<li>Anonymous installation UUID</li>
