			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

			<h3>How do I restore my purchases?</h3>
			<p>
				Open the Power-Up Store in the app and tap "Restore Purchases" at the bottom. This will restore any previously purchased power-up bundles.
			</p>

			<h3>How does the daily puzzle work?</h3>
			<p>
				Every day there's a new puzzle for everyone to play. The difficulty varies by day of the week, with Monday being the easiest and Sunday being the hardest.
			</p>

			<h3>How do leaderboards work?</h3>
			<p>
				After completing a puzzle, you can publish your score to the daily leaderboard. You can also add competitors to track how you compare against friends.
			</p>

			<h3>What are power-ups?</h3>
			<p>
				Power-ups help you during gameplay. You receive a free set of power-ups each game, and can purchase additional bundles from the Power-Up Store:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Skip</strong> — Skip the current piece and get a new one</li>
				<li><strong>Swap</strong> — Swap the current and next pieces</li>
				<li><strong>One-Cell</strong> — Replace the current piece with a single cell</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
			<p>
				You can delete the app to remove all local data. If you'd like your leaderboard data removed, please contact us through the App Store.
