				Get help with GraceLock - Prayer-Based Screen Time
			</p>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>

			<h3>How do I set up app blocking?</h3>
			<p>
				To start blocking apps with GraceLock:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open GraceLock and complete the onboarding</li>
				<li>When prompted, grant Screen Time permissions</li>
				<li>Select the apps you want to block from the app picker</li>
				<li>GraceLock will now show a prayer screen when you try to open those apps</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Why does GraceLock need Screen Time permissions?</h3>
			<p>
				GraceLock uses Apple's Screen Time APIs to block apps and show the prayer screen. These permissions are required for the app to function. Your data stays private - we cannot see which specific apps you block due to Apple's privacy design.
			</p>
