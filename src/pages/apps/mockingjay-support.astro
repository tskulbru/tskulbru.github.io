				Get help with Mockingjay - Secure Video Recording
			</p>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>

			<h3>How do I set up Mockingjay?</h3>
			<p>
				To start using Mockingjay:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open Mockingjay and complete the welcome screen</li>
				<li>Create a PIN (4-8 digits) - this protects your settings and recordings</li>
				<li>Optionally set up a duress PIN for additional security</li>
				<li>Sign in with your Google account to enable cloud backup</li>
				<li>You're ready to record</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>How does the encryption work?</h3>
			<p>
				Mockingjay uses military-grade AES-256-GCM encryption:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Video is split into small chunks (3-10 seconds)</li>
				<li>Each chunk is encrypted on your device before upload</li>
				<li>Encryption keys are stored in Apple's Secure Enclave</li>
				<li>Only you can decrypt your videos - not us, not Google, not anyone else</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Recording</h2>

			<h3>How do I start a recording?</h3>
			<p>
				There are multiple ways to start recording:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Quick start:</strong> Open the app and tap the record button</li>
				<li><strong>Action Button:</strong> Configure your iPhone's Action Button to start recording instantly</li>
				<li><strong>Auto-record:</strong> Enable "Auto-Record on Launch" in settings to start recording when the app opens</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Recording starts immediately without requiring your PIN - this is by design for emergency situations.
			</p>

			<h3>How do I stop a recording?</h3>
			<p>
				To stop a recording:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the screen to reveal controls</li>
				<li>Tap the stop button</li>
				<li>Enter your PIN to confirm</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The PIN requirement prevents someone from easily stopping your recording.
			</p>

			<h3>What happens if I close the app while recording?</h3>
			<p>
				Mockingjay will:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flush and upload the final chunk</li>
				<li>Mark the recording as incomplete in your history</li>
				<li>All footage captured up to that point is preserved in the cloud</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>What if I lose internet connection?</h3>
			<p>
				Don't worry - Mockingjay handles this automatically:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Chunks are queued locally when offline</li>
				<li>Upload resumes automatically when connection returns</li>
				<li>Exponential backoff prevents battery drain during poor connectivity</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Security Features</h2>

			<h3>What is a duress PIN?</h3>
			<p>
				The duress PIN is a secondary PIN that appears to work normally but provides additional protection:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When entered, it wipes local encryption keys</li>
				<li>The app appears to function normally</li>
				<li>Your cloud backup remains intact but inaccessible from the device</li>
				<li>You can recover your recordings later on a new device</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This protects you if someone forces you to unlock the app.
			</p>

			<h3>Why doesn't Mockingjay use Face ID?</h3>
			<p>
				This is a deliberate security decision. Face ID can be used to unlock your phone against your will (by pointing it at your face). A PIN requires your active cooperation to enter.
			</p>

			<h3>How do I change my PIN?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to Settings</li>
				<li>Tap "Change PIN"</li>
				<li>Enter your current PIN</li>
				<li>Enter and confirm your new PIN</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Google Drive</h2>

			<h3>How do I connect my Google account?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to Settings</li>
				<li>Tap "Google Account"</li>
				<li>Sign in with your Google account</li>
				<li>Grant permission to create files in Google Drive</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Where are my recordings stored?</h3>
			<p>
				Recordings are stored in a folder called "Mockingjay Recordings" in your Google Drive. Pro users can customize this folder name. Each recording creates a subfolder containing encrypted video chunks.
			</p>

			<h3>How do I access my recordings?</h3>
			<p>
				Use the Mockingjay app to view and decrypt your recordings:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open Mockingjay</li>
				<li>Enter your PIN</li>
				<li>Go to Recording History</li>
				<li>Select a recording to play</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Note: The encrypted files in Google Drive cannot be played directly - they must be decrypted by the app.
			</p>

			<h2>Subscription</h2>

			<h3>What's included in Mockingjay Pro?</h3>
			<p>
				Pro subscribers get access to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unlimited recording time (free: 60 seconds)</li>

				<li>Unlimited history retention (free: 7 days)</li>
				<li>GPS metadata embedding</li>
				<li>Custom folder names</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>How do I restore my subscription?</h3>
			<p>
				If you've previously subscribed to Mockingjay Pro:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to Settings in Mockingjay</li>
				<li>Tap "Restore Purchases"</li>
				<li>Sign in with the same Apple ID you used for the subscription</li>
				<li>Your premium features will be restored automatically</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>

				Subscriptions are managed through your Apple ID:

				<li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone</li>
				<li>Tap your name at the top</li>
				<li>Tap "Subscriptions"</li>
				<li>Find Mockingjay and tap it</li>
				<li>Tap "Cancel Subscription"</li>

			</p>

			<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

			<h3>Uploads are failing</h3>
			<p>
				If uploads aren't working:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Check your internet connection</li>
				<li>Verify your Google account is still connected in Settings</li>
				<li>Check that your Google Drive has available storage</li>
				<li>Try signing out and back into your Google account</li>
				<li>Force quit Mockingjay and reopen it</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>The app is crashing</h3>
			<p>
				Try these troubleshooting steps:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Force quit the app and restart it</li>
				<li>Restart your device</li>
				<li>Check for app updates in the App Store</li>
				<li>Ensure you have enough storage space</li>
				<li>If issues persist, contact support with your device model and iOS version</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>I forgot my PIN</h3>
			<p>
				For security reasons, we cannot recover your PIN. If you forget your PIN:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your cloud recordings remain safe but encrypted</li>
				<li>You will need to delete and reinstall the app</li>
				<li>You will need to set up a new PIN and encryption keys</li>
				<li>Previous recordings cannot be decrypted without the original keys</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This is by design - it ensures no one can bypass your PIN protection.
			</p>
