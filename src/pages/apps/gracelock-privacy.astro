			<h1>Privacy Policy for GraceLock</h1>
			<p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
				Last updated: January 22, 2026
			</p>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				GraceLock ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our prayer-based screen time management application.
			</p>

			<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
			<p>
				GraceLock is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information necessary to provide our services:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We don't require personal information like your name or email</li>
				<li>We don't access your contacts or photos</li>
				<li>We don't track your location</li>
				<li>We don't read or store the content of your blocked apps</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Screen Time and App Blocking</h2>
			<p>
				GraceLock uses Apple's Screen Time APIs (FamilyControls, ManagedSettings, and DeviceActivity) to provide app blocking functionality. This means:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your selection of which apps to block is stored locally on your device</li>
				<li>We cannot see what specific apps you have blocked - Apple's privacy design prevents this</li>
				<li>App blocking works entirely on-device through Apple's frameworks</li>
				<li>We receive only anonymous, aggregate information about app blocking events</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Prayer and Usage Data</h2>
			<p>
				To provide prayer tracking features, we store the following locally on your device:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Prayer completion records and streaks</li>
				<li>Prayer journal entries (premium feature)</li>
				<li>App usage statistics</li>
				<li>Your preferences and settings</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This data is stored locally and is not transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly use a sync feature.
			</p>

			<h2>Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
			<p>
				To improve the app experience, we use the following services:
			</p>

			<h3>Firebase Analytics</h3>
			<p>
				We use Firebase Analytics to understand general app usage patterns. This includes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Feature usage statistics (anonymized)</li>
				<li>App launch frequency</li>
				<li>Onboarding completion rates</li>
				<li>Device type and OS version</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This data is anonymized and aggregated. We cannot identify individual users from this information.
			</p>

			<h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
			<p>
				We use Firebase Crashlytics to identify and fix app crashes. When the app crashes, it may send:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Device model and OS version</li>
				<li>App version</li>
				<li>Crash stack traces</li>
				<li>Anonymous installation UUID</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Prayer Library</h2>
			<p>
				GraceLock syncs prayer content from Firebase Firestore. This is a one-way sync where we deliver prayer content to your device. We do not upload your personal prayers or journal entries to our servers.
			</p>

			<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
			<p>
				GraceLock offers premium features through subscriptions. Purchase processing is handled by:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Apple App Store</strong> for all transactions</li>
				<li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> for subscription management</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We don't store payment information. All transactions are processed securely by Apple and RevenueCat.
			</p>

			<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
			<p>
				GraceLock uses the following third-party services:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase</a> - Analytics, crash reporting, and prayer content delivery</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a> - Subscription management</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
			<p>
				GraceLock may be used by families with teenagers under parental guidance. We don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app doesn't require any personal information to function.
			</p>

			<h2>Your Rights</h2>
			<p>
				You have control over your data:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Delete the app at any time to remove all local data</li>
				<li>Disable analytics collection in your device settings</li>
				<li>Clear your prayer journal and history within the app</li>
				<li>Revoke Screen Time permissions at any time in iOS Settings</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data Security</h2>
			<p>
				We take appropriate measures to protect your information:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption</li>
				<li>Local data is protected by iOS device security</li>
				<li>We follow Apple's privacy guidelines for Screen Time APIs</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
			<p>
				We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
			</p>

			<h2>Contact</h2>
