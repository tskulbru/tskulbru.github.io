<p>This quote by Kahlil Gibran suits the rapid development in design quality we&rsquo;ve
seen in the digital space over the past years, we continue to see and experience
really beautiful and contemplated design. At this year&rsquo;s Google I/O, Google&rsquo;s design
team presented the thing they&rsquo;ve been spending all their time on, Material Design.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost three years since Google presented their last UI change, Holo,
which many of the popular apps on Android has tried to adopt. Android apps used
to be extremely fragmented when it came to design quality, but over the years as
Holo has existed, more and more apps have that natural android look and feel.
Most Android apps have moved away from the &ldquo;no-design and shitty&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ios-look-a-like&rdquo; infamous design quality in which the early apps had on the platform.
Before this years Google I/O we all got a sneak peek at what we could expect from
the design team with the release of the new Google+ app, which drastically
changed the look and feel of an Android app which we were so accustomed to.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by our study of paper and<br/>ink, yet open to imagination and magic&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Google</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>The entire interface is based on what Google calls a &ldquo;unifying theory of rationalized
space and a system of motion&rdquo;. So what does all of this actually mean? Well what it
essentially boils down to is bringing the interface in line with reality.
&ldquo;Material Design&rdquo; reacts to your touch by displaying a &ldquo;water ripple-like&rdquo; effect
on touchable areas. It presents you with a feeling of depth by using z-index on
certain elements. Animations are also heavily used (where appropriate of course),
which is a big change as Holo didn&rsquo;t really have any animations, where it was more
up to each developer to include animations. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned the water
ripple animation on touch, but there&rsquo;s so much more. I&rsquo;ll let the pictures explain
for themselves.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/material_design_animation.gif' width='' height='' title='<a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1717585-Google-s-Material-Design-Animation">Material Design Animation, by Balraj Chana</a>&lsquo;><span class='caption-text'><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1717585-Google-s-Material-Design-Animation">Material Design Animation, by Balraj Chana</a></span></span></p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/Menu---Back-Arrow.gif' width='' height='' title='<a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/+TaylorLing/albums/6037414075173412353">Actionbar Icon Animation, by Taylor Ling</a>&lsquo;><span class='caption-text'><a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/+TaylorLing/albums/6037414075173412353">Actionbar Icon Animation, by Taylor Ling</a></span></span></p>

<p>Every time I use an app which has Material Design, i smile. It&rsquo;s the coloring,
the animations, the attention to details, just look at the blown up picture above
of the menubar buttons. The animations are subtle and Google really has put a
lot of effort into documenting just how, when, and for how long animation should
be displayed.</p>

<p>Does this help with the earlier mentioned &ldquo;in line with reality&rdquo;?<br/> I&rsquo;ll leave
that up for you to decide.</p>

<h2>Looks cool, now what?</h2>

<p>Earlier when it came to designing for Android, we didn&rsquo;t really have any
resources available, except for the styleguide
<a href="http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/principles.html">&ldquo;Android Design Principles&rdquo;</a>.
So this guy named, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TaylorLing/">Taylor Ling</a>
(you should probably write his name down) created a .psd file with a whole lot
of Holo goodies, the
<a href="http://androiduiux.com/2014/01/10/android-ui-design-kit-for-photoshop-4-4-free-download/">Android UI Design Kit</a>.
This really brought prototyping Android design to a whole new level. Suddenly you
could quick and easily create prototypes which really looked like the end-product.
This guy almost single-handedly changed the way designers prototype apps for Android.</p>

<p>It seems that Google and the Android team really saw something in all of this,
and eventually not only made him a GDE, but with their announcement of
Material Design, also released Illustrator files for all of the different components
which makes up Material Design. I highly suggest you all to take a look at their
resources, <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/resources/layout-templates.html">here</a>.
It&rsquo;s really simple, you just drag and drop the elements you want for the app you
are prototyping, change some colors, and suddenly you have a beautiful prototype.</p>

<p>Using these resources, together with a little Photoshop magic to create animations
together with my prototypes, I&rsquo;ve been able to both shock, and awe clients.
The reason for this isn’t necessarily because the design is so amazingly good,
but more the fact that they don’t expect an app to look that good almost out of the box,
without spending a ton of money for research and design.
Material Design is so thought-through that I don&rsquo;t really need to think that
much on design, colors, and structure as I used to, as long as I follow the
guide presented to me. Eventually I will of course need to slightly diverge from
the guide to suit the needs of my clients, but still, building on top of
Material Design I can still easily achieve a beautiful app.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a guideline, it&rsquo;s there to help you, not constrict you.</p>

<h2>The future</h2>

<p>Google obviously wanted to close the gap between Web, Android and iOS design.
I feel like Apple wanted to catch-up with the &ldquo;flatness&rdquo; of Windows Phone and
Android with their iOS7 release last year, and now Google wanted to try and
stabilize the different platforms. That&rsquo;s the beauty of Material Design, it works
seamlessly on all platforms. It&rsquo;s not as it used to be where if an app on Android
had iOS design it would stand out like a sore thumb, not to mention if anyone
would be ballsy enough to have Android design on iOS.</p>

<p>The future of app design is indeed exciting, and I personally can&rsquo;t wait to see
all the innovating and beautiful designs to come.</p>
