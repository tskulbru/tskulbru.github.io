It's been a while since I've blogged, but today I thought "What the hell". So here I am, with this fancy new Octopress setup.
I must say that so far I'm quite impressed with this framework. Normally I'm a "make it from scratch" kind of guy, but I've heard so many good things about
Octopress that I simply had to try it out. 

I will probably write something more meaningfull later, and I think I should also make a new theme.
